Yahoo::Music::Ratings - A method for retrieving a Yahoo! Music members
song ratings.


This module provides a way to retrieve a user’s list of song ratings
from Yahoo!’s Music service, including the LaunchCast and Unliminted
services.

As Yahoo! do not provide an offical feed for a member to download their
ratings, the methods used within this module are subject to change and
simply may not work tomorrow. However at the time of writing this
README i would suspect the methods used should be stable for atleast a
few days :)

Please perdoc Yahoo::Music::Ratings for full documentation.
