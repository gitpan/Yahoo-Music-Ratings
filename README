Yahoo-Music-Ratings version 1.00
================================

This module provides you with a way to retrieve a user's list of
ratings from Yahoo!'s Music service, including the LaunchCast
and Unliminted services.

As Yahoo! do not provide an offical feed for a member to download
their ratings, the methods used within this module are subject to
change and simply may not work tomorrow. However at the time of 
writing this README i would suspect the methods used should be
stable for atleast a few days :)
